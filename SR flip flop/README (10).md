# SR Flip Flop : 

SR flip-flop operates with only positive clock transitions or negative clock transitions. Whereas, SR latch operates with enable signal.

The operation of SR flipflop is similar to SR Latch. But, this flip-flop affects the outputs only when positive transition of the clock signal is applied instead of active enable.
